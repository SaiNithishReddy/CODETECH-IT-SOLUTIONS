# CODETECH-IT-SOLUTIONS
I am grateful that CODETECH-IT-SOLUTIONS Java Development gave me the chance to intern there. The Oasis Infobyte internship program gave participants a useful perspective on how Java projects in the real world are carried out. We, the participants, were able to learn a variety of Java development skills through this training that would be extremely beneficial in our careers.

# TASK - 1 Tic-Tac-Toe Game:
Develop a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns placing their marks on a 3x3 grid. The program should check for wins, draws, and handle invalid moves.

# TASK - 2 Basic Calculator:
Create a simple console-based calculator that can perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Allow users to input numbers and choose the operation they want to perform.

# TASK - 3 Student Grade Management System:* 
Design a program that can store student information (name, roll number, subject marks) and calculate their overall percentage and grade based on pre-defined grade criteria. Include the ability to add, update and delete student records.

# Task-4 Number Guessing Game:
Develop a program where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts. Provide hints like "too high" or "too low" after each guess.
