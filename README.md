# CODETECH-IT-SOLUTIONS
I am grateful that CODETECH-IT-SOLUTIONS Java Development gave me the chance to intern there. The Oasis Infobyte internship program gave participants a useful perspective on how Java projects in the real world are carried out. We, the participants, were able to learn a variety of Java development skills through this training that would be extremely beneficial in our careers.
